# Google Fiber Customer Service Capstone

## Introduction

This is my capstone project for the [Google Business Intelligence Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/programs/grow-with-google-in-english-2024-82ktl/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence?collectionId=wFdK6). 

For this project, I participated in a fictional interviewing for a BI position on the Google Fiber call center. As part of the interview process, I have to develop a dashboard  that allows them to explore trend in repeat calls. The team needs to understand how often customers call customer support after the first inquiry.

## Background

Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. Currently, the customer service team working in their call centers answers calls from customers in their established service areas. In this fictional scenario, the team is interested in exploring trends in repeat calls to reduce the number of times customers have to call in order for an issue to be resolved.

## Stakeholder's problem

Essentially, the stakeholder is the Google Fiber Customer Service Team. They need to answer the following questions:

- *How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers*
- *What problem types generate the most repeat calls?*
- *Which market cityâ€™s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?*

## Future Improvements

In future iterations of the dashboard, I plan to include KPI cards that display the most relevant metrics at a glance. These cards will help stakeholders quickly identify key insights such as:

- Total number of first calls vs. repeat calls  
- The market with the highest volume of repeat calls  
- The most common issue type that leads to repeat contact  

This enhancement will improve the user experience and make the dashboard more effective for decision-making at a glance.
